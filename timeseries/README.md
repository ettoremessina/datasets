# Time Series
This folder contains a collection of .csv and .arff files synthetically generated applying analytic functions to the values of a sequence representing time.
At moment it contains only a set of datasets created using one-variable real-valued functions; in future I will create new datasets using complexer functions.
Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/datasets/time-series-dataset.html) for details about this collection of datasets.


## Univariate
[univariate](./univariate) folder contains 4 datasets created using one-variable real-valued functions in order to generate a sequence of real values that is the time series; for each time series there is a pair of files: a .csv format file (with header) and a .arff file format (for Weka).
