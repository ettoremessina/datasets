# Datasets
The goal of this repository is to share original datasets create by me; they are useful for training, setup and test of machine learning algorithms and neural networks.

## Synthetic Words
[synthetic-words](./synthetic-words) folder contains audio files that reproduce the pronunciation of 20 English words got using synthetic voices available on the Mac via the command **say**.
The audio files are in wav format and are sampled at 22050 Hz mono; for each word there are 325 wav files obtained with 25 different voices performed at different speeds.

## Functions
[functions](./functions) folder contains a collection of .csv and .arff files synthetically generated applying analytic functions to a closed subset of their own domain.
