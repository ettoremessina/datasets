# y=f(x) : R -> R
This folder contains 9 datasets created using one-variable real-valued continuous and limited functions; for each function there are available both a data file for traning and a data file for test; and for each kind of data a pair of files: a .csv format file (with header with 2 columns labelled X and Y) and a .arff file format (for Weka).
