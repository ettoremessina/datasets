# Functions
This folder contains a collection of .csv and .arff files synthetically generated applying analytic functions to a closed subset of their own domain.
At moment it contains only a set of datasets created using one-variable real-valued continuous and limited functions; in future I will create new datasets using complexer functions.
Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/datasets/functions-dataset.html) for details about this collection of dataset.


## y=f(x) : R -> R
[RtoR](./RtoR) folder contains 9 datasets created using one-variable real-valued continuous and limited functions; for each function there are available both a data file for traning and a data file for test; and for each kind of data a pair of files: a .csv format file (with header) and a .arff file format (for Weka).
